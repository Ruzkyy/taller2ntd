                    <p>Having a pet is a wonderful experience, but it also comes with responsibility. To ensure that
                        your furry, feathery, or scaly companion stays happy and healthy, it's important to provide the
                        right care. Here are some practical tips to help you keep your pet in top shape:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li class="section-heading">
                            <h2 class="section-heading">Establish a daily exercise routine</h2>
                        </li>
                        <p>Exercise is key for pets to maintain a healthy weight, maintain energy, and reduce the risk
                            of disease. For dogs, it's recommended to go for a walk or run at least once a day,
                            depending on the breed and energy level. For cats, although they don't need to go outside,
                            you can encourage activity through play with interactive toys or using scratching posts.</p>
                        <li class="section-heading">
                            <h2 class="section-heading">Interactive Toys and Brain Games</h2>
                        </li>
                        <p>Exercise isn't just physical; it's also important for your pet to exercise their mind. Dogs
                            enjoy games like fetch or puzzles, while cats can play with toys that mimic the movement of
                            prey, such as mice or feathers. These games also help prevent boredom, which can lead to
                            destructive behaviors.

                        <div class="small text-center text-muted fst-italic">Tip: Fetch games, such as hiding treats,
                            can be a great way to keep your pet's mind active.</div>
                        </p>

                            <h3 class="section-heading">Outdoor Activities: Hiking and Parks</h3>
                        </li>
                        <p>If you have an active dog, taking him for walks on trails or to a dog park is a great way to
                            provide extra exercise while having fun socializing with other dogs. Cats can also enjoy the
                            outdoors, but it's recommended to use a special harness if you want him to explore safely.
                        <div class="small text-center text-muted fst-italic">Tip: Make sure the place you take your pet
                            is safe and free from hazards such as aggressive animals or traffic areas.</div>

                        </li>
                        <p>Exercise is only part of the equation. A balanced diet is equally crucial to keeping your pet
                            healthy. Talk to your veterinarian to determine the appropriate amount of food based on your
                            pet's age, breed, and activity level.
                        <div class="small text-center text-muted fst-italic">Tip: Avoid giving your pet too many treats,
                            as this can negatively affect your pet's health.</div>

                            <h5 class="section-heading">Adapt exercise based on age and health condition</h5>
                        </li>
                        <p>As your pet ages, their energy level may decrease. Continue to provide exercise, but adapt
                            activities to their abilities. An older dog may enjoy gentler walks, while a senior cat may
                            prefer quieter play.

                        <p>A key aspect of ensuring your pet stays healthy is taking them for regular checkups with
                            your veterinarian. These exams can detect health problems before they become serious,
                            ensuring your pet can enjoy an active, pain-free life.
